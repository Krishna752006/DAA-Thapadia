NOTE: USE BINARY SEARCH APPROACH


In a small village, there are N water containers arranged in a row. 
Each container has a different amount of water. 
The villagers want to redistribute water so that all containers contain the same amount of water.

However, due to leakage during pouring, P% of the water leaks out whenever water is transferred from one container to another.
That means, if M liters of water are poured, only (100-P)% of M actually reaches the other container.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible amount of water that can be made equal across all containers after redistribution.

NOTE: Print the result with a precision of 5 decimal places. Answers within 10^(-5) of the actual result will be accepted.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space-separated integers, N and P
Line-2: N space-separated integers, containers[]

Output Format:
---------------
Line-1: Print a double value rounded to 5 decimals – the maximum equal liters of water possible in each container.

Constraints
------------
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ containers[i] ≤ 10^9
0 ≤ P < 100

Sample Input-1:
---------------
4 75
2 8 3 12

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4.00000


Explanation:
------------
Initial amounts: {2, 8, 3, 12}
Pouring water while losing 75% each 2time, redistribution finally balances all containers to 4 liters.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
4 50
3 5 8 10

Sample Output-2:
----------------
5.66666


Explanation:
------------
Total water = 26 liters, but with 50% loss during redistribution, not all water can be balanced.
After redistribution, the maximum equal level achievable is ≈ 5.66666 liters per container.
