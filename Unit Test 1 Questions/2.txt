NOTE: USE DIVIDE AND CONQUER APPROACH

A linguistics lab is analyzing a string of characters recorded from a mixed-case sensor.
They define a harmonious segment as a contiguous substring where for every 
alphabetic character that appears, both its lowercase and uppercase forms also 
appear within that same substring.

Your task is to find the longest harmonious segment of the given string.

If there are multiple with the same maximum length, return the one that starts 
earliest in the string.

If no harmonious segment exists, return an empty string.

Notes:
------
Only letters are relevant to the harmony check (a–z/A–Z); 
other characters (digits, punctuation, spaces) may be present but do not affect 
the requirement except by occupying positions in the substring.

The substring must be contiguous.

Input Format:
--------------
Line-1: A string s (may contain letters, digits, punctuation, spaces).

Output Format:
---------------
Line-1: The longest harmonious substring (possibly empty).

Constraints:
-------------
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
s consists of printable ASCII characters

A harmonious substring requires: for every letter c in the substring, both c and 
its opposite case appear in the substring (e.g., if a is present, A must also be present)

Sample Input-1:
---------------
YazaAay

Sample Output-1:
----------------
aAa


Explanation:
------------
Valid harmonious substrings include "aAa" and "azaA". 
The longest is "aAa" (length 3). "azaA" (length 4) is not harmonious because z 
appears without Z.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
Bb

Sample Output-2:
----------------
Bb


Explanation:
------------
B and b both appear in the substring "Bb".

Sample Input-3:
---------------
c

Sample Output-3:
----------------
"" //empty string

Explanation:
------------
Single-character substrings cannot be harmonious since both cases are required.

Sample Input-4:
---------------
abCDxy

Sample Output-4:
----------------
"" //empty string

Explanation:
------------
No contiguous substring contains both cases of all letters present within it.
